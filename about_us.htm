                        a series of maintenance procedures carried out at a set time interval or after the vehicle has
                        traveled a certain distance. The service intervals are specified by the vehicle manufacturer in
                        a service schedule and some modern cars display the due date for the next service electronically
                        on the instrument panel. A tune-up should not be confused with engine tuning, which is the
                        modifying of an engine to perform better than the original specification, rather than using
                        maintenance to keep the engine running as it should. </p>

                    <p class="pclass1">A motorcycle, often called a motorbike, bike, or cycle, is a two- or
                        three-wheeled motor vehicle.[1][2][3] Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of
                        different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and
                        off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social
                        activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies. </p>

                    <p class="pclass1">Street bikes include cruisers, sportbikes, scooters and mopeds, and many other
                        types. Off-road motorcycles include many types designed for dirt-oriented racing classes such as
                        motocross and are not street legal in most areas. Dual purpose machines like the dual-sport
                        style are made to go off-road but include features to make them legal and comfortable on the
                        street as well.Each configuration offers either specialised advantage or broad capability, and
                        each design
                        creates a different riding posture. </p>

                    <p class="pclass1">We take your choice for the engine oil you want in your bike Motor oil, engine
                        oil, or engine lubricant is any one of various substances that consist of base oils enhanced
                        with various additives, particularly antiwear additives, detergents, dispersants, and, for
                        multi-grade oils, viscosity index improvers. Motor oil is used for lubrication of internal
                        combustion engines. The main function of motor oil is to reduce friction and wear on moving
                        parts and to clean the engine from sludge (one of the functions of dispersants) and varnish
                        (detergents). </p>
